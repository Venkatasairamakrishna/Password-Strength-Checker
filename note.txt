In this project, we will create a password strength checker that can help users create strong 
passwords for their online accounts.The tool will analyze the user's password and provide
a score based on its strength level.It will also provide feedback on how the user can improve
the strength of their password.

Tools and Technologies:
   Programming Language: Python
   Libraries: re, getpass

Steps to Implement:

Step 1: Get Input from the User

The first step is to get the user's input for their password. We will use the getpass module to 
get the password from the user without displaying it on the screen.

Step 2: Check Password Strength

We will define a function that will check the password's strength by analyzing its length, use 
of upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. We will assign a score to the
 password based on these factors.

Step 3: Provide Feedback to User

We will provide feedback to the user based on the score of their password. We will display a
 message to the user that their password is weak, moderate, or strong. We will also provide
 suggestions on how they can improve the strength of their password.

Step 4: Run the Password Strength Checker

Finally, we will run the password strength checker program, and the user will be prompted to
 input their password. The program will analyze the password and provide feedback to the user.
